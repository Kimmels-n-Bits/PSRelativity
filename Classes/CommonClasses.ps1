#TODO: Implement RelativityObjectSecuredValue class
<#
    This replaces the RelativityAgentRequestSecuredValue class and classes dependent on that class will need to be refactored.
    This needs to support, at minimum, Int32, String, and RelativityObjectRef as types for the Value property.
    [Boolean] $Secured
    [Object] $Value
